# Introduction 
This is the path for remote internship at datamonk. 

Few things to note for this internship 
- This is a hands-on internship, not an online course. 
- This material should be used to help you get familiar with key technologies that will be used in the project down the line. 
- At the end, we will have a capstone project, that you will be working alongside experienced software engineers. 
- Please join the Slack community on https://datamonk-internship.slack.com . You should also install the slack app on your mobile device, so that you don't miss meetings or important notifications by mistake.
- We will have a virtual meeting on "google meet" once in a week. Everyone doing this program is required to join this "google meeting" session. This allows us to know how you are doing.
- You will also be required to submit assignments after key milestones.
