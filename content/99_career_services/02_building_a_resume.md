## Make your Resume ATS friendly

### What is ATS?
Most companies use ATS to filter resumes based on job description keywords.

### How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly:
- Use standard headings: "Experience", "Skills", "Education"
- Avoid tables, columns, graphics, and PDFs with non-selectable text
- Tailor resume content using keywords from the job description
- Stick to simple fonts (e.g., Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Submit your resume in .docx or PDF (text-based) formats

## Tailor each resume for the job 
- Read the job description carefully
- Identify top 5 skills/technologies they want
- Customize your resume to highlight matching projects, roles, and achievements
- Use quantifiable results: “Improved test coverage by 25%”, “Reduced API response time by 50%”

## Other tips 
- Use Action oriented words: Start each bullet with an action verb such as "Developed, Engineered, Led, Designed, Built, Automated, Improved, Analyzed, Integrated, Researched."
- Don't use one resume for all the jobs: Customise the resume for the role and company.
- Project matter: Include projects that are relevant to the job.
- Update Regularly: Update the resume every 3-6 months to include new skills, experience and accomplishments. 
- Test before sending: Upload your resume to free ATS checkers like [Jobscan](jobscan.co) to ensure keyword match.
- Don't include everything in your resume. Only list things that you are confident about.  

## Checklist Before Submission
- Is it 1 page?
- Are bullet points action-driven and quantifiable?
- Does it mention the key job-specific skills?
- Is it free of spelling and formatting errors?
- Is it ATS-friendly (no columns, charts, or unusual fonts)?
