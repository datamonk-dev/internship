## Company Careers Page: Direct and Reliable
Most top companies post jobs only on their own website before putting them on portals.

How to Use:
- Make a list of your target companies
- Visit their Careers page weekly
- Bookmark or subscribe to job alerts if available

Example:
- For Razorpay → Go to https://razorpay.com/careers
- For Google India → https://careers.google.com/locations/india/

Bonus Tip:
If there’s no relevant job open, email HR or fill the “Open Application” form (many startups accept them).

## Referrals Through Employees
Why Referrals Work:
- Internal candidates are often trusted more.
- Referred applications get priority in the ATS.
- Many employees get referral bonuses — they want to help!

How to Get a Referral:
- Go to LinkedIn and find someone working at the company.
- Connect with a short, custom message:

"Hi, I'm a CS grad interested in a backend role at Razorpay. Would love to learn more about your experience. Could we connect?"

- After 3–5 days, politely request a referral with your resume + job link.

##  Conferences & Tech Meetups
Attending industry events gives you:
- Face-to-face time with recruiters
