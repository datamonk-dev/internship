# S3 — Your Unlimited Online Drive

Let’s say you have 10,000 vacation photos, a bunch of documents, some cat videos, and a few memes you *swear* are important.

You could store them on:

* Your phone (but it gets full),
* Your laptop (but it could crash),
* Google Drive (can get some value after paying but limited free space and features),

Or… use **Amazon S3**
---

## Why S3?

S3 stands for **Simple Storage Service**. But don't let the name fool you — it’s one of the most powerful and widely used services on AWS.

**Why is it so popular?**

* You can store **unlimited files**.
* Files are automatically backed up and replicated.
* It’s used by Netflix, Airbnb, Dropbox… and now, you.
* You only pay for what you store (even ₹1 is not wasted).
* You can access your files globally, securely, and fast.

Whether it's a website logo, an app image, backups, user uploads, or static HTML files — **S3 is your go-to vault**.

---

## How Does S3 Work?

Imagine S3 like a giant **locker room**. Inside that locker room, you get:

* **Buckets** = your personal lockers
* **Objects** = the files you store inside them (images, PDFs, backups, etc.)
* Each object gets a **unique key**, like a file path or name

S3 doesn’t run your code. It just holds your stuff — neatly, safely, globally.

And every object you store is:

* **Redundantly stored** across multiple facilities (your file won’t disappear if one server crashes)
* **Versioned** (if enabled) so accidental overwrites don’t kill your work
* **Public or private**, depending on access settings

---

## Why Is It So Cheap?

"Let's be honest, one can get 1 TB of SSD for 5-6k rupees, so storage is cheap—yet AWS isn't a charity. But S3 is insanely affordable, even at scale.

**Why?**

* It’s *cold storage*, not hot compute (it just sits there quietly until needed).
* It’s **highly optimized** — Amazon’s storage infrastructure is one of the most efficient on the planet.
* You get to **choose your storage class** based on how often you access the file.

## Storage Classes — Not All Files Are Equal

You wouldn’t keep your winter jackets in your living room in June, right?

S3 lets you move your files into different **storage classes** based on access frequency.

| Storage Class          | Use Case                  | Cost     | Speed                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| Standard               | Daily use                 | High     | Fast                    |
| Intelligent-Tiering    | Mixed access patterns     | Medium   | Fast                    |
| Infrequent Access (IA) | Once in a while           | Low      | Fast                    |
| Glacier                | Rarely accessed archives  | Very Low | Slow (minutes to hours) |
| Deep Glacier           | Old logs, compliance data | Lowest   | Very Slow (hours)       |

You can even **automate moving files** between these tiers — using Lifecycle Policies.

## Lifecycle Policies — Let Files Age Gracefully

Let’s say you have:

* Product images from 2021 that no one downloads anymore
* Backup logs that are only needed for 6 months

You can create **Lifecycle Rules** like:

* After 30 days → Move to Infrequent Access
* After 90 days → Move to Glacier
* After 365 days → Delete permanently

This saves space and money — *like setting your wardrobe to auto-clean itself.*

---

## Buckets — Where Everything Lives

Buckets are like folders — but global, secure, and powerful.

Each bucket:

* Must have a **globally unique name** (`my-bucket-2025`)
* Is created in a **specific AWS region**
* Can have **versioning** enabled
* Has **permissions** and **access controls**

Inside the bucket, you can:

* Upload files manually
* Organize with folder-like paths
* Set policies to allow or restrict access

And yes — you can make **a static website** using just an S3 bucket!

---

## Using S3 with the Command Line

Once your AWS CLI is set up, you can do magic like:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://my-cool-bucket
aws s3 cp hello.png s3://my-cool-bucket/
aws s3 ls s3://my-cool-bucket/
aws s3 rm s3://my-cool-bucket/hello.png
```

This feels like `scp` or `rsync`, but for your cloud drive.

Also useful for scripting automated uploads, backups, and deployments.

---

## Bucket Access Policies

You don’t want your sensitive files floating around the internet.

S3 gives you **fine-grained access controls**:

* **Bucket Policy**: Set permissions at the bucket level using JSON
* **IAM Policies**: Attach permissions to users or roles
* **ACLs** (Access Control Lists): Old-school, use rarely

You can say things like:

> "Allow public access to images/\*\* but block uploads from anonymous users."

Or:

> "Only allow this EC2 server to write into this bucket."

S3 is powerful, but **be careful with public access** — many data leaks happen because someone accidentally made a bucket public.

---

## Exercise

Let’s try out your first S3 bucket:

 Create a new S3 bucket
 Upload an image or PDF
 Make it publicly viewable (don’t worry, just for testing)
 Open it in your browser — yes, it’s now live on the web!
 Now delete it and try with AWS CLI
