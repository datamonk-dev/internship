### Introduction

You might not realize it yet, but Linux has quietly taken over the world. It powers your phone, your Wi-Fi router, your car, and quite possibly your fridge. It's everywhere; invisible, reliable, and open.

In this lesson, we’re not diving into commands or kernels just yet. Instead, we're going to **pull back the curtain** and show how deeply embedded Linux is in your daily life. By the end, you'll understand why we recommend Linux as the go-to development environment and hopefully, you’ll be curious (and bold) enough to install it.

### Linux in Your Everyday Life

Let’s be clear: Linux is not just an “OS for nerds” anymore — it’s become the **default operating system for the planet**.

#### Personal Uses

- **Android phones** — Every Android device runs a modified version of the Linux kernel. That's over **3 billion** active devices.
- **Smart TVs** — Brands like Samsung and LG use Linux-based platforms.
- **Laptops and desktops** — Especially among developers and power users.
- **Steam Deck and PlayStation** — Gaming consoles like Steam Deck run on **SteamOS**, a Linux distro optimized for games.

<div class="lesson-note lesson-note--tip" markdown="1">
Yes, the thing you scroll memes on, play games on, and binge Netflix on — all powered by Linux.
</div>

#### Smart Homes

- **Wi-Fi routers** — The firmware that keeps your internet flowing? Probably Linux-based.
- **Smart speakers & assistants** — Devices like **Amazon Echo** and **Google Nest** use Linux behind the scenes.
- **Home automation hubs** — Many run custom Linux builds tailored for IoT.

#### Transportation

- **Infotainment systems** — Car dashboards, GPS interfaces, and entertainment consoles run on embedded Linux.
- **Autonomous vehicles** — Self-driving tech uses Linux for sensor integration, machine learning, and real-time systems.

#### Work and Enterprises

- **Cloud computing** — Platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure run mostly on Linux virtual machines.
- **Web hosting** — Over **90% of the web’s servers** are Linux-based.
- **Software development environments** — Most programming languages and frameworks are born on or made for Linux.

#### Finance and Retail

- **ATMs** — Many banks rely on customized Linux environments for their ATM networks.
- **POS (Point of Sale) terminals** — The system your coffee shop uses to bill you? Linux inside.
- **Stock exchange systems** — They need speed, reliability, and security — Linux delivers.

#### Public Infrastructure

- **Air traffic control** — These systems demand precision, uptime, and speed.
- **Public transit systems** — Ticketing, signaling, scheduling all often powered by robust Linux systems.

The next time you're catching a flight or tapping your metro card, just know: Linux is working overtime.

### The Numbers Don’t Lie

- Over **3 billion** Android devices = Linux kernel.
- Over **12 million** web servers = Linux-powered.
- Millions of routers, ATMs, IoT gadgets = Linux inside.

Yet, Linux holds only around **4% of the desktop market**. Weird, right?

<div class="lesson-note lesson-note--warning" markdown="1">
Desktop Linux adoption is low; not because it's bad, but because Windows comes pre-installed. That’s changing fast.
</div>

### Why Do We Recommend Linux for Developers?

####  Free of Cost

Windows? Pay for a Home or Pro license.  
macOS? Buy a Mac.  
Linux? **Completely free** — always has been, always will be.

#### Ultimate Flexibility

Linux is **yours to modify**. Customize your window manager, change your terminal’s look, tweak system behavior, write automation scripts — all out of the box.

#### Open Source = Learn More

Want to know how the system actually works? Read the source code. Want to contribute? You can.

Linux helps you learn from the inside out, not just use software but **understand** it.

#### Developer-First Ecosystem

Install languages like **Python**, **Rust**, **Node.js**, **Go**, and tools like **Docker** and **Kubernetes** with native support.

macOS may come close, but Linux is still the first-class citizen in open-source tooling.

### Understanding Linux Distributions (Distros)

Linux isn’t one monolithic system; it’s a kernel with many flavors called **distributions** (distros). These families are the major ones:

#### Debian Family

Beginner-friendly and well-supported. Great for starting out.

- **Ubuntu** – Most popular desktop Linux distro.
- **Linux Mint** – Ubuntu-based with a Windows-like UI.
- **Pop!\_OS** – Developed by System76, geared toward developers and gamers.

#### Red Hat Family

Enterprise-grade. Used in businesses and server environments.

- **Fedora** – Cutting-edge, community-supported.
- **RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)** – Commercial support, widely used in companies.
- **CentOS / Rocky / AlmaLinux** – Free alternatives to RHEL.

#### Arch Family

Minimal and bleeding-edge. Requires confidence and time.

- **Arch Linux** – Build-it-yourself distro for power users.
- **SteamOS** – Built on Arch; optimized for gaming on Steam Deck.

<div class="lesson-note lesson-note--warning" markdown="1">
New to Linux? Stick with **Ubuntu** or **Linux Mint**. Arch is great, but not if you're still learning what a terminal is.
</div>

### Ready to Join the Club?

Next, we’ll install **Ubuntu 24.04** — the latest long-term support (LTS) release, perfect for beginners.

By installing Linux, you’re not just trying something new, you're joining a **global community of makers, hackers, and creators** who believe in sharing knowledge and controlling their own tools.

Let’s go add one more to the 3 billion+ club.
