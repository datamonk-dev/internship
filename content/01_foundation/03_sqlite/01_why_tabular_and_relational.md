## **Lesson 1: Why Tabular Data Matters**

You’ve probably seen or worked with tables before—whether it’s a list of students in class, your monthly expenses in a spreadsheet, or a basic contact list. All of these are examples of tabular data.

In simple terms, tabular data means information organized in rows and columns. It’s neat, readable, and makes searching or updating things much easier.

Why do we care about this? Because most useful information in real life fits naturally into tables. Whether it’s tracking sales, keeping employee records, or managing transactions—tabular data is often the cleanest way to store and handle it.

###  Exercise:

Try to open any spreadsheet on your system and ask yourself: what’s stored in the rows and columns? Can you think of a way this kind of data might grow if the business scales?

## **Lesson 2: Why We Use Relational Databases**

Let’s say you’re working with a lot of data—maybe a list of customers, plus another list showing their purchases. If you try to store everything in one giant table, it becomes a mess fast. You’ll have repeated info all over the place, and small changes (like a phone number update) will become a pain.

This is where *relational* databases come in. Instead of cramming everything into one place, you split your data into separate tables and link them together using a common value (like a customer ID).

So your customer details stay in one table, and their transactions go in another. Want to know which customer made which purchase? Just connect the dots using that ID. Clean, simple, and easy to maintain.

###  Exercise:

Look up how SQLite connects two tables using a common column like `customer_id`. You don’t have to write code—just focus on understanding how they “relate.”

## **Lesson 3: A Quick Tour of Relational Database Systems**

There are many tools out there that help you store and manage tabular data using this relational model. Some are big and powerful, used by large companies. Others are lightweight and perfect for beginners or small projects.

Here are a few popular ones:

* **SQLite**: Tiny, simple, and doesn’t need a server to run. Ideal for learning and small apps.
* **MySQL**: A go-to for many websites and apps. Requires setup but offers more power.
* **PostgreSQL**: Very reliable and packed with advanced features. Great if you’re building something more complex.
* **SQL Server**: Microsoft’s offering—popular in large enterprise systems.

If you’re just getting started, **SQLite is your best friend**. It’s just a file on your computer—no extra configuration or tools needed. You can start practicing SQL right away and build real apps.

Think of it as training wheels for databases—but ones that are good enough for real-world apps too (it’s used in browsers, phones, and even operating systems).

###  Exercise:

Check the size of an SQLite database file once you've created a small table. How big is it? Can you find where the file is saved?
