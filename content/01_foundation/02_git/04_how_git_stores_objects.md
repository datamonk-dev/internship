# The `.git` Directory — What’s Happening Behind the Scenes

You’ve been using Git for a while now — running commands like `git add`, `git commit`, `git stash`, and maybe even `git reset`.

But what’s actually going on in the background?

The moment you run `git init`, Git creates a hidden `.git` folder in your project directory. This is the brain of your Git repository. Everything Git does is stored and managed here.

Let’s peek inside and see what each part does, using your portfolio project as the backdrop.

---

## `.git/` — The Hidden Folder That Runs the Show

This is automatically created when you run `git init`. Inside it lives everything Git needs to track changes, manage history, and store configuration.

Think of it as the secret control room for your entire project.

---

## `.git/config` — Your Project’s Git Settings

This file stores configuration settings that apply only to the current repository.

For example:

* Your Git username and email
* Remote repository URL (like GitHub)
* Branch defaults

In your portfolio project, if you connect to GitHub with `git remote add origin`, that info gets saved here.

This is like your project’s personal preferences. Try to look into your config files because you never know until you do it and dont forget to drink water (but save water, drink beer).

## `.git/objects` — Where Git Stores the Magic

This is where Git stores everything: your files, commits, trees, and more — but not as traditional files.

Git saves content in a unique format using something called a **SHA-1 hash**. You’ll learn more about that shortly.

Each time you commit something (like your `index.html` or `about.css`), Git compresses and stores the content here in a way that makes it fast and efficient.

This is your project’s permanent memory.

---

## `.git/refs` — Tracking Where Things Point

Git needs to know where your branches and tags are currently pointing. That’s what `refs` does.

Inside:

* `heads/` holds the current position of each branch
* `tags/` holds references to tagged commits

When you switch from your `main` branch to a `new-feature` branch, Git updates these references.

This helps Git know which commit each branch is currently on.

---

## `.git/hooks` — Automate Actions with Custom Scripts

Hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow.

Example:

* You could set up a hook to automatically format your HTML or run a linter before every commit.
* Or show a warning if someone tries to commit with the word “Babu Rao Ka Style Hai” in the message.

For your portfolio, imagine a pre-commit hook that stops you from committing unoptimized images.

These aren’t enabled by default — but when you're ready to level up, they’re super powerful.

---

## `.git/index` — The Staging Area

When you run `git add`, your files don’t go directly into a commit. They go into the **index** first.

This file acts like a checklist of what will be included in your next commit.

It’s how Git knows exactly what you’ve staged.

If you’ve added `index.html` but haven’t committed yet, it lives in `.git/index` until you commit.

---

# How Git Stores Objects — It’s Not Just Copy-Paste

You may think Git just stores your files like a Dropbox folder. But it’s much smarter — and more efficient — than that.

---

## Git Uses the SHA-1 Algorithm

Every object in Git whether a file, folder, or commit — is converted into a unique string of 40 characters called a **SHA-1 hash**.

For example, when you commit `index.html`, Git calculates a SHA-1 hash for the content. If you make any change, even a single space, the hash changes completely.

This ensures every object is uniquely identified.

It looks like this:

`f7c3bc1d808e04732adf679965ccc34ca7ae3441`

This string acts like a fingerprint for the file or commit.

---

## Why SHA-1? Git Needs Checksums

Git uses this hash as a **checksum** a way to guarantee the integrity of your data.

If a file changes or gets corrupted, the checksum won’t match anymore, and Git knows something is wrong.

This is what gives Git its confidence: it always knows exactly what your files looked like at every point in history.

---

## Objects Stored as Blobs, Trees, and Commits

Git doesn’t store your files by name. It stores content as objects:

* **Blobs** store file contents
* **Trees** represent folder structure
* **Commits** point to trees and include metadata (message, author, etc.)

When you commit your `index.html` and `about.css`, Git stores the contents as blobs, groups them into a tree (like a folder), and then creates a commit that points to that tree.

This structure makes Git:

* Fast at comparing changes
* Smart about not storing duplicates
* Reliable for going back in time

---

# Wrap-Up

The `.git` directory may seem mysterious, but it's just a well-organized system of internal files and folders that:

* Track your changes
* Store your files securely
* Ensure your history is accurate

And thanks to hashing and objects, Git is more than just a version control tool and t’s a powerful, trustable engine for your entire development journey.

## Try this

> Open a Git project and locate the hidden .git directory.

> List all files and folders inside .git and write what you think each does.

> Open the .git/config file and note any user info, remotes, or branch settings.

> Add and commit a new file to your repo and check if anything changed in .git/objects.

> Reflect on which part of Git internals surprised you and why.

> Pick a Git project with commits, make a small change, commit it, and observe how the commit hash changes.

> Look inside .git/objects before and after the commit and note what changed.

> Write in your own words why Git uses hashes and how that helps with tracking and integrity.
