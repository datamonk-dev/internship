## 5 W's of Python
Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, with its first release in 1991 — designed to be a language that’s easy to read, write, and learn. But what exactly is Python? It’s a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its clean syntax and powerful libraries that make tasks like web development, data analysis, automation, and AI accessible to all. Python is used everywhere — from startups building MVPs to tech giants like Google, Netflix,etc. When did Python rise to the top? Its popularity surged in the 2010s alongside data science and machine learning, but its steady evolution and community support have kept it relevant ever since. And why is Python so loved? Because it lowers the barrier to entry while remaining powerful enough to tackle complex, real-world problems — making it a language not just to learn, but to grow with.
