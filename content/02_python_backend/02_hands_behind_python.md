# The Hands That Shape Python
Python’s success as a programming language is not just due to its simplicity and power, but also because of the strong ecosystem of organizations and individuals that support its development and smooth functioning. From its creator to global foundations and major tech companies, several groups play a vital role in maintaining, improving, and promoting Python across the world.
>*"As Uncle Ben Parker once said, *"With great power comes great responsibility."*
This responsibility of maintaining and evolving Python is shared by many dedicated organizations and communities."*

Some of the most influential among them include:

## Where It All Started (CWI)

- Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 while working at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), a Dutch national research institute in Amsterdam.
- CWI, known for major contributions to programming and computer science
- CWI hosted the first Dutch internet connection, helping introduce the internet to Europe.

## CNRI Hired Guido : The Artist
- CNRI (Corporation for National Research Initiatives) is a U.S.-based non-profit supporting the development of internet and network-based technologies.
- Hired Guido van Rossum in the late 1990s to continue Python’s development and released Python 1.6 in 2000.
- Licensing conflicts during this time led to the formation of a neutral, independent foundation to oversee Python — **the Python Software Foundation (PSF)**.
- Founded in 1986 by Robert E. Kahn, co-inventor of the TCP/IP protocols that form the backbone of the internet.

## Python Software Foundation (PSF)
- The PSF is the official non-profit organization behind Python, founded in 2001 to oversee its development, licensing, and promotion.

- It ensures Python remains open-source and freely available, while managing trademarks, Python releases, and infrastructure like **python.org** and **PyPI.**

- The PSF actively promotes diversity and inclusion through initiatives like **PyLadies, Django Girls, and a strong Code of Conduct**.

- It supports the Python community through grants, sponsorships, and recognition programs like the PSF Fellow Program.
## People For Python
- The Python community is a global, welcoming network of developers, educators, and enthusiasts who work together to evolve and support the language. Its growth is not only measured in numbers but in collaboration, openness, and shared knowledge.

- A key part of this process is the PEP system (Python Enhancement Proposals)—a formal mechanism where anyone in the community can propose new features or improvements. Major Python features like f-strings, async/await, and the walrus operator all began as PEPs.

- This collaborative spirit thrives at PyCon, the community’s flagship conference held across the world. PyCon brings people together through expert talks, hands-on workshops, and coding sprints, making it a hub for innovation and inclusion.

- From just 240 attendees at the first PyCon in 2003 to nearly 3,000 in 2024, and a global developer base of over 18 million, Python’s growth is powered by a strong, vibrant, and ever-expanding community.
## Python Package Index (PyPI)
- You’ve probably typed pip install without thinking—because  just how Python works. Behind the scenes is PyPI (Python Package Index), Python’s very own App Store, where developers share tools and libraries like requests, pandas, or flask. One command, endless possibilities.

- With over **500,000** projects and growing, PyPI is what makes Python so powerful, beginner-friendly, and fun — because whatever you want to do, someone has probably already built a package for it!

- pip is maintained by the **Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)**—a team of dedicated volunteers who build and manage Python’s packaging tools. Thanks to PyPA, pip remains fast, secure, and seamlessly connected to PyPI.
## Brain For Data Science (NumFOCUS)
- NumFOCUS is a non-profit organization that supports open-source scientific computing tools, especially in the Python ecosystem.

- It provides financial and administrative backing for major Python-based projects like NumPy, pandas, Jupyter, and SciPy.

- While not directly involved in Python’s core development, it plays a key role in ensuring the sustainability and growth of data science tools used with Python.

- It's like the parent in the background of a science fair, making sure everyone has snacks, batteries, and a working presentation—so the real stars (the tools) can shine.

## Big Tech Behind Python

- Tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Dropbox, IBM, Red Hat, and Intel have supported Python by employing core developers and funding its growth.
- Guido van Rossum worked on Python while at Google and Dropbox.
- Microsoft maintains Python support in VS Code, contributes to CPython, and integrates Python with Azure.
- These companies boost Python’s development, performance, and global reach.

## Community Initiatives & Groups
- PyLadies: A global initiative that encourages women’s participation in Python through mentorship, meetups, and workshops, promoting diversity and inclusion in tech.

- Django Software Foundation (DSF): Oversees the development of Django, one of Python’s most widely used web frameworks, ensuring its growth, governance, and open-source status.

- PSF Working Groups: Volunteer-driven teams within the Python Software Foundation focused on specific goals like translation, education, infrastructure, and diversity.

- Regional Python Communities: Local groups and events like PyCon India, PyCon Europe, and Python meetups foster grassroots growth, knowledge sharing, and community bonding.
